_My First Yeoman Generator_ :rainbow:

Creates the skeleton of a Jekyll blog post in the style that I use in my blog.

### Example

For a blog post called 'Bish Bash Bosh' you'd get something like:

Filename: `2016-02-12-bish-bash-bosh.markdown`

```
---
layout: post
title: Bish Bash Bosh
date: 2016-02-12 23:17:42
comments: true
published: false
categories:
-
---

# Your blog post goes here
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-clekyll
```

Run the generator.

```bash
yo clekyll
```

It will create the file in the current directory.

You can add a category to the post. If you choose not to add one, a blank category will appear. That's fine, Jekyll doesn't mind. You can manually add more than one category if you like, Jekyll doesn't mind that either.

*To-Do:* (1) Check for `yo-rc.json` existence and create in `/_posts` if it exists. (2) Allow adding more than one category.

## N.B.

Jekyll might get in a but of a tizz if you have a node_modules folder within the project structure - delete it and/or install generators somewhere other than within the Jekyll project.

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman is a secretive knobhead as evidenced by the sparse and disorganised documentation for him online. Don't trust a word he says. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
